This plugin allows players with the permission `hwteleportation.home` to set home locations. **`/sethome <home>`**  
The player can teleport to their home locations. **`/home <home>`**  
You can set up a cooldown in the configuration file so players can only teleport to a home every few minutes.  
  
## What are Warps?

This plugin allows admins with the permission `hwteleportation.admin` to set warp locations. **`/setwarp <warp>`**  
Players with the permission `hwteleportation.warp` can teleport to these locations. **`/warp <warp>`**  
You can set up a cooldown in the configuration file so players can only teleport to a warp every few minutes.
